    <p id="tribute-info">The <strong>Universe</strong> is everything we can touch, feel, sense, measure or detect. It
      includes living things, planets, stars, galaxies, dust clouds, light, and even time. ... The Universe contains
      billions of galaxies, each containing millions or billions of stars. The space between the stars and galaxies is
      largely empty</p>
    <section>
      <h2>What is the universe?</h2>
      <p>The universe is everything. It includes all of space, and all the matter and energy that space contains. It
        even includes time itself and, of course, it includes you.
        Earth and the Moon are part of the universe, as are the other planets and their many dozens of moons. Along
        with asteroids and comets, the planets orbit the Sun. The Sun is one among hundreds of billions of stars in
        the Milky Way galaxy, and most of those stars have their own planets, known as exoplanets.
      <p>
      <p>The Milky Way is but one of billions of galaxies in the observable universe — all of them, including our own,
        are thought to have supermassive black holes at their centers. All the stars in all the galaxies and all the
        other stuff that astronomers can’t even observe are all part of the universe. It is, simply, everything.

      <h2>How universe is created?</h2>
      <p>Our <b> universe<b> began with an explosion of space itself - the Big Bang. Starting from extremely high
            density and temperature, space expanded, the universe cooled, and the simplest elements formed. Gravity
            gradually drew matter together to form the first stars and the first galaxies.<p>
